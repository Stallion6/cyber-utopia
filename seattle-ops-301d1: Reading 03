Points that I took away from today’s reading:

Cybersecurity issues are prevalent and can put a deal into jeopardy: Over half of respondents (53%) report their organization has encountered a critical cybersecurity issue or incident during an M&A deal that put the deal into jeopardy.

Organizations are placing more focus on a target’s cybersecurity posture than they did previously: 81 percent of respondents agree that they are putting more of a focus on a target’s cybersecurity posture than in the past, highlighting that cyber is a top priority for both IT and business decision makers.

An undisclosed data breach is a deal breaker for most companies: 73 percent of respondents agreed that a company with an undisclosed data breach is an immediate deal breaker in their company’s M&A strategy.

Decision makers sometimes feel they don’t get enough time to perform a cyber evaluation: Only 36% of respondents strongly agree that their IT team is given time to review the company’s cybersecurity standards, processes and protocols before their company acquires another company. 

Internal IT teams may lack the skills to conduct cybersecurity assessments: Among ITDMs, only 37% strongly agree that their IT team has the skills necessary to conduct a cybersecurity assessment for an acquisition.

Organizations allocate third party resources to their cybersecurity assessments: Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that their organizations spend money on outside contractors for IT audits or cybersecurity risk assessments.

Connected devices and human error put organizations at risk: When asked what makes organizations most at risk during the information and technology process, two answers stood out: human error and configuration weakness (51%) and connected devices (50%). 

Devices often get overlooked and missed during integration: Over half (53%) of respondents say they find unaccounted for devices after completing the integration of a new acquisition. 

Failure to address cyber risk can lead to major acquisition regrets: Nearly two-thirds of respondents (65%) said their companies experienced regrets in making an M&A deal due to cybersecurity concerns
