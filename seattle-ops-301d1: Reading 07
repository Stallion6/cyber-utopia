Segmentation divides a network into sub networks.  The intent is to improve security and performance.

Segmentation controls how fraffic flows within the network.  You can limit the flow by traffic type, source or destinaition.

How you segment the network is called segmentation policy.

Some traditional forms of enforcing segmentation include firewalls, Access Control List (ACL) and Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN).

Benefits of network segmentation include:  Improving operational performance, limiting cyberattack damage, Protecting vulnerable devices and reducing the scope of compliance.

Let's discuss Trust Assumption and Zero Trust Response:

Trust Assumption: Individuals within the perimeter are assumed to be trustworthy and therefore are not a threat.  Thus, they were subject to few restrictions on their ability to access information.

Zero Trust Response:  Zero Trust assumes that nobody is trustworthy by default, even those already inside the network perimeter.
